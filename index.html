  <h1>Stop learning framework after framework</h1>

  <p class="leadin">
    Frameworks are awesome, and Javascript has a ton of them, both for frontend and for backend. They make life a lot simpler – sometimes.
  </p>

  <p class="leadin">
    But sometimes, the learning curve of learning a framework is simply not worth the effort.
  </p>

  <p class="leadin">
    <span class="primary-text">Frameworkless.js</span> is a tutorial series to help get you up and running with your own awesome app built almost entirely from Node.js and plain, vanilla javascript.
  </p>

  <h2>What frameworkless.js covers</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>An HTTP server using Node's own <code>http</code> module</li>
    <li>Routing and templating</li>
    <li>Using plain SQL instead of ORMs, and how to work it safely</li>
    <li>Forms – not always needing Ajax!</li>
    <li>Frontend assets – how to set up CSS and Javascript pre-processors</li>
    <li>Does your frontend really need a framework to be "reactive"?</li>
    <li>Finishing touches: Gzip, Pjax, and more</li>
    <li>Writing tests with Node.js's `assert` library</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Method</h2>

  <p>
    We are going to build a real live app together. <span class="primary-text">Seriously.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    No fake assignments like incrementing counters with a click of a button. We're going to gradually build, from start to finish, a whole app.

  <h2>Who is this course for?</h2>

  <p>
    You should have some basic Javascript knowledge. CSS and HTML are obviously a plus. The course will be a series of videos in english, but I'm not Shakespeare – if you can read this page, you will be able to understand my videos even if English is your second (or third or fourth or <i>nth</i>) language.

  <h2>What does it cost?</h2>

  <p>
    The base material will be <span class="primary-text">free, for everyone, forever</span>.
  </p>

  <p>I will probably add some more advanced paid tutorials, however.</p>
